            Log file are now written to the working directory prepared by amarok:
            ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts-data/amakode.log
            (previously they were written to /tmp/amakode.log;
            this prevented use by multiple users on the same machine and
            was vulnerable to symlink attacks)
