Amakode Changelog

Version 1.8

Support for reading tags from mp4 files thanks to victor rajewski.


Version 1.7

(never released on kde-apps)

Better handling of errors. Amakode now checks that its slave programs
(lame, etc) are properly installed. Any errors (either from Amakode
or from those slave programs) are now reported using Amarok popups.

Transcoding from urls

Fixed some temp file leaks


Version 1.6

First import from Daniel O'Connor at
http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/AmaKode?content=48218
Changelog before that date says:
    Fix problems with newer versions of mpg123 (kontakt@lombacher.net)
    Add output support for wav.

Better logging of errors for debugging

Fix non-ascii tag handling

Log file are now written to the working directory prepared by amarok:
~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts-data/amakode.log
(previously they were written to /tmp/amakode.log;
this prevented use by multiple users on the same machine and
was vulnerable to symlink attacks)
