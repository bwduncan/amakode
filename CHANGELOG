Amakode Changelog


2008-09-07  First import from Daniel O'Connor at
            http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/AmaKode?content=48218
            Changelog before that date says:
                Fix problems with newer versions of mpg123 (kontakt@lombacher.net)
                Add output support for wav.

2008-09-07  Better logging of errors for debugging

            Fix non-ascii tag handling

            Fix bug preventing use by multiple users on the same machine;
            include username in log file. Note this this is still not
            secure against symlink attacks; log should be moved somewhere
            safer.
