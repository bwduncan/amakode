Amakode is a script for Amarok to transcode music.

It is written purely in Python and uses various external executables to do the grunt work.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

* Python 2.4

* tagpy (used to copy tags between transcoded files). Amakode will work without tagpy,
  but its output will have no tags.
